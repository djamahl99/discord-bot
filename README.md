# Last FM Bot

## Introduction

This bot was the Last.fm bot for the Deep Cuts Discord Server whilst I was still an admin there. 

Deep Cuts (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYhCg0DHloE9gn-PAiAYNg) is a YouTube channel that provided video essays on music.

The bot features a "currently playing" command named "fmi" that produces a beautiful image of the current song the user is playing on their connected Last.fm account. This feature made the bot quite popular on the music discord. The original server for this is down but an example is still up at http://djamahl.byethost15.com/fm.
